## Description
Merge/watermark pictures with the Harvard Summer School logo.
The idea is that you take a picture of you and another Summer School friend and this app will have a series of 'frames', which are pictures with transparency, and will merge those pictures.

It will merge them without asking for login.  If you register
- you can save your pictures in the server
- you can upload your own frames

Project according to the specs of [Project 4](http://dwa15.com/Projects/P4).

## Details for teaching team
No login required.

## Outside code
* Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/
